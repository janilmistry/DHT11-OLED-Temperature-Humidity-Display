# DHT11-OLED-Temperature-Humidity-Display
This project uses a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with an OLED display to read and show the current temperature, humidity, and heat index. The sensor values are updated every 2 seconds on the OLED screen and also printed to the Serial Monitor for debugging purposes. The heat index is calculated using both Celsius and Fahrenheit values, and sensor errors are displayed if readings fail.
